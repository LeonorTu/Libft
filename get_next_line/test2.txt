A total of 501,036 people have visited Ateneum Art Museum so far this year, marking a record-breaking year for the popular cultural venue.

"This is an exceptional achievement, considering that the Ateneum did not open until mid-April this year, following a ventilation renovation," the museum noted in a press release.

The half a million visitor mark was broken on Sunday 10 December, the statement noted.

The previous record was set in 2017, when 440,828 people came to see exhibitions including Treasures from the National Gallery of Duckburg and The von Wright brothers.

This year the exhibitions included A Question of Time, exploring themes including nature and modern life, as well as a collection of the works of renowned Finnish artist Albert Edelfelt, and the current installation, entitled Colour & Light â€“ The Legacy of Impressionism.

"I'm really happy and grateful that our audiences have found us after three years of exceptional circumstances. It is great to leave the Ateneum to my successor after such an accomplishment, and I hope for more success in the years to come," said the museum's director, Marja Sakari, who is set to retire at the end of the year.
