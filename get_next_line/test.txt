Makers of some popular food brands have raised prices by more than their costs over the past two years, according to the UK's competition watchdog.
This has helped push up the price shoppers pay for baby formula, baked beans and pet food, the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) said.
About three quarters of branded suppliers have been making more profit on individual products.
But food firms said they had done all they could to absorb higher costs.
The findings are part of an analysis of pricing in 10 categories, which also includes milk, poultry, mayonnaise, baked beans, chilled desserts, ready meals, and lemonade.
